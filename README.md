# learning to work with LCD character 16 * 2 and I2c.
------------
## Installing the library
First you need to download the zip file in **[_docs, LiquidCrystal_I2C library_](https://github.com/aradsoltani88/LCD-character-16-2_Arad_Soltani_MRA1400/tree/main/docs/LiquidCrystal_I2C%20library)** directory and install it in your arduino in the zip way. To do that, in your arduino, click on the **_Sketch_** icon and then **_include library_** and at last inset the library you already downloaded by clicking the **_add .zip library_**. Now you have the library.
------------
## Things you need
To work with your 16 * 2 LCD you need:
1. A 16 * 2 character LCD with the I2c module being mounted on it.
2. An arduino board with some wires.
3. The knowledge to do that.

## Learning how to connect the LCD with I2c module on it and how to work with the functions
First, make sure to read the **[_datasheet_](https://github.com/aradsoltani88/LCD-character-16-2_Arad_Soltani_MRA1400/tree/main/docs/datasheet%20of%20LCD%20character%2016%20*%202)** of the LCD which is in **[_docs_](https://github.com/aradsoltani88/LCD-character-16-2_Arad_Soltani_MRA1400/tree/main/docs)** directory so you know more things about it. Next you need to connect your LCD to your Arduino and to do that go to **[_code_](https://github.com/aradsoltani88/LCD-character-16-2_Arad_Soltani_MRA1400/tree/main/code/example%20code)** directory and the **[_function learning.md_](https://github.com/aradsoltani88/LCD-character-16-2_Arad_Soltani_MRA1400/blob/main/code/example%20code/function%20learning.md)**. also there you will learn all functions needed to run and work with your LCD. Also make sure to test the example file in **[_code_](https://github.com/aradsoltani88/LCD-character-16-2_Arad_Soltani_MRA1400/tree/main/code/example%20code)** directory to see if everything is going well.
