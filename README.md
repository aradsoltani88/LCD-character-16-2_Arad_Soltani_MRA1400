# learning to work with LCD character 16 * 2 and I2c.
------------
## Installing the library
First you need to download the zip file in **"docs, LiquidCrystal_I2C library"** directory and install it in your arduino in the zip way. To do that, in your arduino, click on the **Sketch** icon and then **include library** and at last inset the library you already downloaded by clicking the **add .zip library**. Now you have the library.
------------
## Things you need
To work with your 16 * 2 LCD you need:
1. A 16 * 2 character LCD with the I2c module being mounted on it.
2. An arduino board with some wires.
3. The knowledge to do that.
------------
## Learning how to connect the LCD with I2c module on it and how to work with the functions
First, make sure to read the **datasheet** of the LCD which is in **docs** directory so you know more things about it. Next you need to connect you LCD to your Arduino and to do that go to **code** directory and the **function learning.md**. also there you will learn all functions needed to run and work with your LCD. Also make sure to test the example file in **code** directory to see if every thing is going well.
